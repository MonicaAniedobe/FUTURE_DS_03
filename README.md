# Road Accident 

This  project presents a comprehensive analysis of road accident data with the aim of uncovering patterns and insights related to accident severity, vehicle involvement, road conditions, weather effects, and geographical distribution.

## Project Overview

Road safety remains a critical issue globally. By visualizing and analyzing historical road accident data, this project helps identify key factors that contribute to road accidents. These insights can inform safety measures and policy improvements.

## Objectives

- Understand the distribution of accident severity (slight, serious, fatal)
- Analyze casualties by vehicle type (car, bus, van)
- Explore the impact of road types and lighting conditions on casualties
- Identify accident-prone areas based on location data
- Visualize the effect of weather and road surface conditions on accident frequency

## Tools Used

- **Power BI**: For data modeling and visualization
- **Microsoft Excel**: For initial data cleaning and transformation
- **GitHub**: For version control and project showcase

## Key Visuals in the Dashboard

- **Accident Severity Summary**: Total count of slight, serious, and fatal accidents
- **Casualties by Vehicle Type**: Breakdown of casualties involving cars, buses, and vans
- **Total Casualties by Road Type**: Insights on which road types are more prone to accidents
- **Impact of Light Conditions**: Analysis of casualties under different lighting (daylight, darkness, etc.)
- **Urban vs Rural Distribution**: Comparison of accident data by area type
- **Geographical Map (Heatmap)**: Locations with high accident density using latitude and longitude
- **Road Surface & Weather Filters**: Slicers for interactive analysis

## Insights Derived

- **Most accidents** were **slight**, with serious and fatal ones being significantly fewer.
- **Cars** were involved in the majority of casualties.
- **Dual carriageways** had the highest total casualties among road types.
- **Darkness (without lighting)** conditions saw a higher number of casualties compared to daylight.
- **Urban areas** recorded more accidents than rural ones.
- **Cornwall and Kerrier** appeared as top locations based on accident density.

## How to Use

1. Download the `.pbix` file from this repository.
2. Open it using [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/).
3. Use the slicers for Road Surface and Weather Conditions to filter insights dynamically.
4. Hover over visuals for detailed tooltips.

## Future Improvements

- Integrate time series analysis for yearly or monthly trends
- Predictive modeling using Python integration in Power BI
- Incorporate traffic density and speed limit data
